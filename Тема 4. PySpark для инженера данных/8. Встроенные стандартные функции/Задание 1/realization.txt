|{[19342], 987160, 2022-05-31 23:57:38, {image, https://company.com/cdn/K79BCJlco8}, If you feel like you’re losing your hearing, it’s because you quite possibly are. In fact, more than six million people in the United States between the ages of 18 to 44 suffer from hearing loss.\nTo tackle the problem, Fritz Lanman’s new company Doppler Labs is announcing Dubs Acoustic filters, otherwise known as extra fancy ear plugs.\nFrom the website:\nDubs is the brain child of Lanman and co-founder and Doppler Labs CEO Noah Kraft. The idea here is that a totally mechanical device can be attractive, immersive, and improve the audio experience without sacrificing sound.\nThe Dubs are built of 17 individual mechanical pieces (made from materials like steel, polymer foams and silicone) that reduce general volume by an average of 12 decibels. This allows you to go to something like Coachella, with fourteen hours of head-pounding music, without feeling like your ears are ringing for the next 48 hours.\n“When we were designing Dubs, we thought a lot how we could make them truly immersive,” said Kraft, who has spent his career in the media world, including consulting for Google, where he became passionate for the wearables industry. “We didn’t want them to be like hearing aids that are flesh-toned, but rather wanted them to have a sleek look that didn’t distract other people who are talking to our customers.”\n\nThe Dubs do just that. They sit in the ear like a black little button, but aren’t visible when you’re facing the wearer head-on.\nBut perhaps more impressive than the form or function is the price.\nTo make Dubs accessible to all potential consumers (not just audiophiles, but folks who just walked into a concert), Doppler is pricing the product at $25, with availability starting now from Soul Cycle. Best Buy will also be selling the Dubs starting in November.\nAs you might remember, Doppler Labs is one of two companies started by Fritz Lanman recently. Doppler Labs, in particular, is run by Kraft, Lanman and Dan Wiggins, with Dubs launching as its very first product.\nYou can learn more about Dubs here.\n, 987160, 19342, null, 1120092, null, null, null, null, null, null, [noah-kraft, fritz-lanman, doppler-labs, dubs], null}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |message     |2022-05-31|23  |57    |38    |

The company today is announcing that it has raised $27 million in a Series C round. This also marks the first time that Netbiscuits, which says it hosts over 110,000 mobile web apps and sites, has disclosed the value of a raise since first opening for business in 2000. This latest investment was led by new investor Stripes Group, and also had participation from existing investors T-Venture (Deutsche Telekom’s VC arm) and Creathor.\nCo-founder and CEO Michael Neidhoefer tells TechCrunch that the investment is a sign of the “tipping point” that we are now seeing in mobile web usage, and how companies like his are taking investment now to meet that opportunity: “Mobile phones are in many places outselling PCs,” he notes. But with the market still showing little sign of consolidation, companies are investing to build their own businesses to grow organically. “We will be using this to invest in sales, marketing and R&D, but acquisitions are not part of our strategy.” In addition to working with brands on their B2C offerings, Netbiscuits also provides a platform for B2B enterprise mobility services.\nBecause of Netbiscuits’ legacy — it was founded in 2000, when WAP was often still the only game in town — it has a strong tie to offering development, publishing and monetizing services on mobile web sites. Neidhoefer says that this is still the case today, as usage moves away from feature devices and on to tablets and smartphones.\nAlthough Netbiscuits was founded in Germany, Neidhoefer says that more than 50% of its business is currently in North America, with Europe a strong number two and the followed by Asia Pacific and Latin America. That also translates to a stronger market for smartphone-based applications.\nAnd while there is some evidence that app usage is pulling away from mobile web as the main way that people access content on those handheld devices, Neidhoefer says that in fact a lot of those native apps — especially on Android — are just HTML5 in native wrappers. And that is only becoming more common.\n“Native apps can be hard to maintain and expensive,” he says. “So there is a need to move to HTML5. Over the next two years, some 50% of all native apps will be hybrids.” Which just happens to be exactly where Netbiscuits sits as a business. He says that this is particularly true in ecosystems like Android’s, which faces fragmentation not only in devices but also in versions of the platform. Gartner, incidentally, takes Neidhoefer’s 50% one step further: it says that by 2015, eighty percent of all mobile applications developed will be hybrid or mobile-Web-oriented.\nHe also believes, like many supporters of HMTL5, that the gap between native app functionality and what can be done on HTML5 is closing — although that point of view can be problematic in the present day, where high-profile companies like Finelook have made very pronounced about-faces on their mobile web strategies by taking some steps back into native apps after finding the experience on HTML5 on platforms like iOS simply not good enough.\nDespite hiccups like this, though, there’s still a lot of belief that the mobile web will be the way ahead, says Netbiscuits’ new investor: “The mobile web market is seeing huge growth and the Netbiscuits team is leading the industry in cutting-edge mobile web solutions. From our perspective the timing of this investment is ideal and it will allow Netbiscuits to ride the crest of the mobile web wave,” Dan Marriott, managing partner at Stripes Group, said in a statement., 247511, 26358, null, 1119043, null, null, null, null, null, null, [collaboration, pride, doubledutch, html5, mobile-web, netbiscuits], null}|message     |2022-05-31|23  |56    |53    |

In the enterprise world, however, the company has also made a name for itself with its Appcelerator Platform, which is meant to help large companies build apps and mobilize their data. Today, the company is launching a major update of this platform that gives enterprises more flexibility in how they build their apps and how they get their data into them.\nThe days when big companies had 100 percent control over their stack are long over, in large part because of the rise of mobile devices and cloud computing. The company says that today’s update will help companies prepare better for this “post-web reality,” as Appcelerator calls it.\nAs part of this, Appcelerator is making a major shift in how it is making its platform’s capabilities available to developers. Previously, the only way to use the company’s backend services and analytics was by writing a Titanium app. Now, however, the company has released a native SDK for iOS and Android that allows developers to integrate these tools, whether or not the app was built on its platform.\n\nAs Appcelerator founder and CEO Jeff Haynie tells me, some of his customers use up to 200 different line of business apps in their companies. “Not all of them are using our tools, but now they can use our single dashboard to manage them,” he told me. “We want to give customers choice.” This doesn’t mean the company is not focusing on Titanium anymore, though. Appcelerator is still heavily investing in Titanium, Haynie noted.\nThe other major feature in today’s release is the launch of Appcelerator’s API Builder, which makes it easier for companies to take data from their legacy databases and make it accessible for their own mobile apps or maybe even outside consumption. “We found that we made it easy and fast to build mobile apps,” Haynie said. “But a lot of the time, developers are waiting to figure out how to get data from their systems into their mobile apps. With API Builder, we are trying to get this data mobile.” The company offers a number of connectors for most of the popular database systems, as well as Salesforce and other platforms.\nOther new features in today’s update include an improved analytics service that now makes it easier to create custom views and funnels, as well as the ability to use the Appcelerator Platform in a private cloud for organizations that need to comply with regulatory requirements that prevent them from using off-premise hosting.\n , 748847, 79792, null, 1098621, null, null, null, null, null, null, [appcelerator], null}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |message     |2022-05-31|23  |56    |27    |

Many human resources department now use application tracking software (ATS) to help them sift through hundreds of applications.\nWhile this saves them time, it means that promising applicants might get tossed out just because their resume don’t have the right keywords. Startup Jobscan helps job seekers figure out how to craft their resumes or CVs to get past ATS.\n“There are people who were working for ten or twenty years and then they got laid off or had to switch jobs. Now they don’t even know how to find a job because when they first started working, they could write a resume, mail it in and it would be reviewed by a real person,” says founder James Hu. “But now you are just a record in the system.”\nHu was inspired to develop the software because he had trouble finding a job in the U.S. after a two-year stint working in China. He’d spend hours poring over job descriptions for keywords to insert in his resumes, but rarely heard back from companies.\nHu built Jobscan, which was launched in January 2014 and is currently bootstrapped, to automate the process of identifying keywords in order to increase the chances of landing an interview. Recommendations from college career service departments and organizations that aid people searching for jobs helped the startup, which claims to have scanned more than 100,000 resumes so far, gain traction.\n There are more than 300 applicant tracking software systems available and Jobscan says it is able to identify keywords used by 90 percent of employers.\nThe startup differentiates from other resume tools like Resumebuilder.org by focusing specifically on keywords. Jobscan automatically finds important terms and phrases in a job description and shows users how frequently they appear. Then it compares their resume against the description and makes suggestions on how to improve it.\nIn a job description for a software engineering position, keywords not only include programming languages like C++, but also terms that are related to the software development cycle such as “product management,” “product vision,” and “STLC (software testing lifecycle)”—industry-specific patois that many applicants might not think to include until after they read dozens or hundreds of job descriptions.\nMany of Jobscan’s users are nurses, veterans, software engineers, sales staff, and teachers. Hu says Jobscan can process resumes for almost any kind of job right now, but the startup, which includes co-founder Michael Lee, a former Google engineer, is improving the platform to include more specific job functions.\nThe software will also be expanded to include support for different languages.\nJobscan currently monetizes through a subscription plan. Users get five free scans per month, but the startup gives 50 free scans to people who have been unemployed for a year or longer.\nHu says Jobscan makes enough revenue to be self-sustaining and is currently reinvesting its earnings into features to make the software more usable.\n“Our demographic of users include people who are less technically savvy,” says Hu. “Some are older and they sometimes want to print out the results and take it to their career coach so they can work together and figure out how to improve their resumes.”, 396845, 151897, null, 1136857, null, null, null, null, null, null, [ps4, sony, resumes, job-search, rap-genius, educational, ipad, itunes-u, apple, lucidcam], null}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |message     |2022-05-31|23  |52    |15    |
